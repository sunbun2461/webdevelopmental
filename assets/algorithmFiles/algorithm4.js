//Check if a value is classified as a boolean primitve. Return true or false


	function booWho(bool){
		return ((typeof bool == 'boolean')? true: false);
	}

console.log(booWho(null));


//easy function to write. I used ternary operator to simplify things, once I 
//realized I needed to check the type, it came about relatively quickly.
